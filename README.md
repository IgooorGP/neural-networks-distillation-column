# Distillation Column Simulation Software

This was my undergraduate thesis project. I created a very simple object-oriented simulation software for distillation columns that used a previously trained neural networks.

To assert the precision of the simulation results, I also built and configured a small distillation column (pilot one) with thermal sensors, pumps and a supervisory system.

# Code

The simulation software and Neural Networks were developed using the Matlab language.

Well... at least there was a class!
